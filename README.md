# Analysis-Crime-API
An JavaScript application with ExpressJs. Its objective is let everyone who wants make an analyse about their own city, neighbour, whatever. It needs a database within all data you need. 

Here you can get results at an especific period such as crime total, average per month, growth rate, and you can choose search for general crimes result or even only one category of. Every result will give you informations about for each crime. In this case, crimes like theft, robbery, burglary and violentes are by default.

The source of data is the Police UK API, and their docs are available at: https://data.police.uk/docs/method/crime-street

If you have another source of data you like more, you can make changes in this project to use that source. If you like, make a fork and help our community to improve this API for crime analysis, because everybody should have an opportunity to know how safe they are.
